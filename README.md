Heya! Hallöchen! Bonjour! Heisann!
==================================

I'm Max, although you might also know me as Alyner or Alyner3. I'm a half-French, half-German physics student (3rd year, BSc) at the University of Münster whose been passionate about computers and programming from a young age.

Speaking of physics: I'm especially interested in computational methods, simulations, and materials physics. Beyond that, I love learning languages. Right now, I'm learning Norwegian (Bokmål), and it's a lot of fun!
